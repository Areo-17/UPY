Hello everyone!

We have an exciting task ahead of us: efficient car data management. We have 15 cars, each with five key attributes: Name, Price, Speed, Windows and Doors. Our mission is to develop a robust and efficient code that allows:

Add a car to the corresponding list (example: the name is added to 'CarNames').
Edit the data of an existing car.
Remove a car from the list.
Query cars (print data from one position).

Our goal is to make this task an example of excellence in data management. Let's work together to create an elegant and efficient solution that demonstrates our commitment to quality.

Note: If you have any questions or need clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us through the chat channel. Together, we can achieve excellence in automotive data management.
