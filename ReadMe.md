# UPY (Universidad Politécnica de Yucatán) - Personal Repository

## Description
There are multiple purposes for this repository, which include:
- Have a public documentation of all the lessons / tasks / projects that I'm making during my carrer.
- Have a repository where my team and I can work for doing our task / projects.
- Share the knowledge to anyone who wants to learn more about "Data Science Engineering".

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The creation of some files and projects were made in teams, so there will be a "Read Me" file which will contain the names of the participants.
